## What is Coin Chaser?
### Motivations and Aims
This is a repository for my Level 4 university project. The goal of the project is to create an interactive game for the public to play using a screen attached to a building (ARC) and smartphones that allow the players to control the game on that screen. 

### Tools and Technologies
* <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Real-Time Development Platform</a>: to develop the game for the public display
* <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>: to store the project in a backed-up repository and manage issue tracking
* <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>: to launch the game onto a website using the index file at the root of the GitHub repository
* <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a>: a JavaScript API, used to render the game onto the hosted website and enable game interaction through browser scripting
* <a href="https://smartcontrollerjs.github.io/SmartController/">SmartController</a>: a JavaScript package that must be imported into the browser script to provide the phone controller interface and to establish communication between the smartphone and display

## Playing the Game

### Play Online
To play the game online simply navigate to <a href=https://smartcontrollerjs.github.io/Coin-Chaser/>https://smartcontrollerjs.github.io/Coin-Chaser/</a> and scan the displayed QR code with your smartphone. This will send you to a controller interface as shown below, where you can start to control your character using the SmartController!
