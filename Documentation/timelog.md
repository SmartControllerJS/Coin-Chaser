## Week 18

* *1.5 hours* Meeting with supervisor and peers. Decided the WebRTC issue was probaly due to an extension I had on Firefox, so no need to worry about it.


## Week 21

### 7 February 2022
* *6 hours* Successfully implemented smartController with jump button, but the function sends too many jumps at once, adding to player jump hight

### 10 February 2022
* *3 hours* Attempted to debug jump issue, no real success. Might have to do with smartController library.

### 11 February 2022
* *1.5 hours* Meeting with supervisor and peers. Emma suggested replacing the processData function with a simplePeer function used in the package to solve Jump issue. 
* *1 hour* Tried to see how many jump requests were sent in a second to see how to solve issue. Jumping requests were sent too fast and holding button down added to the jump.
* *3 hours* Solved jump issue and now added horizontal movement with smartController too using simplePeer function Emma sent. 
* *.5 hour* Made it so that the QR code generated varies for each page the game is open in. Got rid of unique ID

* *1.5 hours* Created different shaded players that should be able to recieve individual commands. 

### 20 February 2022

* *2 hours* Debugging game crash with multiplayer after spawning player1. Might be due to use of dictionaries in CamScript.

## Week 23

### 21 February 2022
* *2 hours* Successfully debugged game crash with multiplayer after spawning player1. Dictionaries in C# cannot have value changed when iterating over them
* *2.5 hours* Added multiplayer functionality and talked to Emma to see if method used is efficient 
* *3 hours* Added function to unactivate a player if they disconnect from the game
* *1 hour* Moved QR code to center of webpage above game, got rid of unnecessary buttons on page

* *1 hour* Combined left and right movement to one method, taking an integer parameter [-1, 0, 1] to represent movement
* *0.5 hour* Simplified jump method to have less if conditions that take boolean values

### 2 March 2022
* *7 hours* 2D tiling for level design worked awkwardly with the grid, being slightly off center. Deleted tiling assets and instead created a 2D Sprite Shape object which has a more flexible design approach
* *1 hour* The polygon colider on the players allowed them to glitch through walls due to the complex shape flipping with animation. Used a simpler capsule collider instead.

### 3 March 2022
* *3.5 hours* Added coin collection functionality with each player having their own score count in their copies of the script. Got Thatleah_Pixel font from Unity asset store.
* *1.5 hours* Player-to-Player collision now makes them bounce slightly
* *2 hours* Added jump power-up with functionality

## Week 25

### 7 March 2022

* *1 hour* Realized there is a bug with the particle system implemented last week. Only shows one particle, then no other.

### 9 March 2022
* *5 hours* Tried to fix the particle system. No success but use of SetActive might be a problem. Can use Play and Stop instead but these seem not to change anything.

### 11 March 2022
* *3 hours* Reworked the particle system logic. Particles now display as required with the Play() and Stop() functions rather than the SetAwake() which only looped once.
* *2.5 hours* Added functioanlity to the scores on the leaderboard. Now they update when the leaderboard appears and then reset each player score when it disapears
* *.5 hour* Changed the jump button on the controller to the "a" button
* *1 hour* Meeting with supervisor and peers. Showed game update, asked about plan for evaluation, discussed tasks for next week.
